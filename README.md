# COMP90041 Final Project (Semester 1, 2023): Decision Engine for RescueBots

This is the final individual project of the Course [COMP90041 Programming and Software Development](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90041) at the University of Melbourne @ Semester 1, 2023. It is designed to help students gain valuable experience in developing comprehensive, object-oriented solutions in Java programming languague that incorporate ethical considerations in decision-making processes.

## Introduction:
Each student is a software developer at RescueBots Inc., a pioneering robotics company dedicated to creating technology that aids in life-threatening situations, particularly during natural disasters such as bushfires and floods. The company has recently unveiled a fleet of autonomous robots capable of navigating unknown terrains to locate and rescue individuals in need. While these RescueBots have proven effective, there is a critical need for a decision engine to enhance their autonomy. The decision engine is tasked with prioritizing and determining the order of rescue operations, a challenge with significant ethical and moral implications.

## Project Overview:
In this project, students will be responsible for creating the decision engine for RescueBots. The objective is to develop a program that explores different scenarios and makes critical decisions about which location to save during rescue operations. The scenarios involve multiple locations, each with distinct longitudes and latitudes, and inhabitants with varying characteristics, including gender, age, and weight. The program must decide which location to save in each scenario, considering that the robots can only rescue one location at a time.

## Key Features:

**1. Decision Algorithm:**
  * Implement a decision algorithm that determines the order of rescue operations.
  * The algorithm can be designed manually by the user or automatically using a built-in decision algorithm.
  * Allow students the freedom to design their decision algorithm, considering ethical and moral implications.

**2. Scenario Generation:**
  * Scenarios can be predefined through the import of a CSV file or randomly generated by the program.
  * Each scenario includes multiple locations with inhabitants of different characteristics.

**3. User Interaction:**
  * Enable manual decision-making by users to select the order of rescue operations in each scenario.
  * Implement an interface for users to judge and evaluate outcomes based on their decisions.

**4. Statistics and Logging:**
  * Display statistics after each run, grouping saved species by traits such as age category, gender, and body type.
  * Create a log file to record the entire history of program runs, aiding in auditing and statistical analysis.

## Covered Concepts:
This assignment is designed to cover fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Java, including but not limited to:
  * Console I/O
  * File I/O
  * Flow control (if statements, loops)
  * Classes and methods
  * Encapsulation
  * Method overloading
  * Constructors
  * Arrays and ArrayLists
  * Inheritance and polymorphism
  * Interfaces
  * Error handling
  * Generics
  * Java doc

## Assessment Criteria:
The project was evaluated based on the effectiveness of the decision algorithm, the accuracy of statistics, the user interface, and the overall adherence to OOP principles and Java concepts.
  * **Program Execution:** Automated Tests
  
  * **System Architecture:**
    
      Including: Code structure resembling real-world entities. Clear hierarchy by using separate, well-named files for generics, abstract, and concrete classes. Use of package(s) to modularise code.
    
  * **OOP & Encapsulation:**
    
      Including: Proficient use of modifiers (private, public) with appropriate getter/setter methods. Considering privacy leaks. Well-considered usage of static methods and free of redundant object passings.
    
  * **Polymorphism:**
    
      Including: Proficient use of generics, abstract classes or interfaces, and inheritance. Classes are well-designed without redundancies and with elegant overloading.
    
  * **Control Flow:**

      Including: Easily traceable program flow. Loops have clear breakout conditions. Proficient use of switch and if-else statements.
  
  * **Data Structures & Algorithms:**
    
      Including: Proficient use of a wide range of data structures. Elegant algorithmic design. Proficient use of the Java standard library and of java data types.
  
  * **Scenario Randomization:**
    
      Including: True, well-balanced randomisation of all features and characteristics.
    
  * **Logfile:**

      Including: Easy to read in ASCII format. Contains all information necessary to reproduce the scenario and decisions without redundancies.
  
  * **Style:**

      Including: Consistency around naming conventions and descriptive naming of classes, methods, and variables. Program code is well indented, spaces are sufficient, and avoidance of overly long lines of code.
  
  * **Documentation and Javadoc:**

      Including: Javadoc created without errors. Following javadoc conventions. All major classes and methods are annotated. Additional in-line comments clarify complex program sections.
  
  * **UML:**

      Including: Major classes and methods are listed with their correct association arrows and multiplicity values. The spatial arrangement allows for easy reading and shows a clear hierarchy between classes. Package allocation is correctly displayed.
